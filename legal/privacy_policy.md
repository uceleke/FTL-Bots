# Privacy Policy for ARC Loot Bot

**Last Updated:** 20251113

This Privacy Policy explains how **ARC Loot Bot** (“the Bot”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and stores information when users interact with the Bot on Discord.

By using the Bot, you consent to the data practices described in this Policy.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

The Bot only collects and processes the **minimum data required** to operate and respond to commands. This may include:

### **1.1 Automatically Collected Data**
When interacting with the Bot, Discord provides us with:
- User IDs  
- Server IDs  
- Channel IDs  
- Message content associated with Bot commands  
- Command options (item names, parameters, etc.)  
- Interaction metadata (timestamps, component interactions, etc.)

This data is **not stored permanently** unless explicitly configured by the server owner via external services.

### **1.2 Data Collected Through External Integrations**
If your server uses integrations such as:
- **n8n workflows**
- **Custom APIs**
- **Webhooks**
- **GitHub-hosted loot tables**
- **Databases or logging systems**

Then **those external systems may store data**.  
This storage is controlled by the **server owner**, not by the Bot developer.

We do **not** manage, access, or control external data stores created by other server owners.

---

## 2. How We Use Collected Information

The Bot uses provided data only for the following purposes:

- Responding to slash commands and interactions  
- Processing item lookups or loot table data  
- Sending messages or replies within Discord  
- Triggering external workflows (if configured)  
- Ensuring the Bot operates correctly and efficiently  
- Debugging or improving Bot functionality (non-identifiable logs only)

---

## 3. Data Storage & Retention

### **3.1 Default Behavior**
By default, the Bot:

- Does **not** store message logs  
- Does **not** create user profiles  
- Does **not** permanently save any personal data  
- Only processes data in real-time to execute a command

No data is retained beyond the execution of the command unless required for:

- Rate limit handling  
- Temporary session-state operations (milliseconds–seconds)
- Error recovery logs (ephemeral)

### **3.2 Developer Logging (Minimal & Non-identifying)**
For debugging, we may store short-term logs which may include:
- Server ID  
- Command name  
- Error messages  

These logs **never** contain:
- Message content  
- Usernames  
- User IDs  
- Personally identifiable information

Logs are automatically cleared on resets or updates.

### **3.3 External Integrations (User-Controlled)**
If server owners configure automation platforms like **n8n**, **webhooks**, or custom scripts:
- They may store message content or user data  
- They are responsible for the security & privacy of that data  
- You should review the privacy policies of those platforms  

We do **not** store or access this data.

---

## 4. Sharing of Data

We do **not**:
- Sell personal information  
- Share personal data with advertisers  
- Provide user information to third parties outside Bot functionality  

Data may be shared only with:
- **Discord** (as part of their API operations)
- **External services explicitly configured by the server owner**

We do not control how third-party services handle data.

---

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect data processed during runtime, including:
- No permanent user data stored by default  
- No remote databases maintained by the Bot  
- Limited, non-identifying logs  
- Secure hosting environments depending on your deployment

Server administrators using external integrations must configure their own security.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

The Bot does **not** knowingly collect data from children under 13 years old.

Use of the Bot is subject to **Discord’s minimum age requirements**, which vary by region.

---

## 7. Your Rights & Choices

Because the Bot does not store personal data:
- There is no personal data to request, review, edit, or delete  
- You can stop data processing at any time by removing the Bot from your server  
- You may disable integrations or commands at any time  

If an external service (e.g., n8n) stores your data, contact the server administrator for removal.

---

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Policy may be updated periodically.  
The “Last Updated” date will be revised when changes are made.

Continued use of the Bot after changes are posted indicates acceptance of the revised Policy.
